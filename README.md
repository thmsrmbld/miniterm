## Welcome to miniterm!

Miniterm is a tiny, in-browser terminal emulator designed to be used as a
personal portfolio website for back-end developers who are terrible at design. It
emulates the behaviour of a bash / linux terminal - and you can add your own
custom commands to create an interactive, command-line style personal / CV site!

#### Check it out live and in action at: https://miniterm.ahumanfuture.co

(Use the 'ls' command to list the commands it comes with.)

## Miniterm is:

* Super simple / light - it's just three files of vanilla HTML, CSS and
 JavaScript.
* Open-source and easy to customise!
* Sort of responsive. Kind of. Well...who's using terminal on their phone
 anyway?

## Get started now!

* Because it's only three files of HTML, CSS and JS, you can do whatever you
 like with it. Netlify is an easy option.

## Notes

* Take note when customising the JavaScript - the auto-generated class names
 are key to making sure the script works properly.
* It should be self explanatory where in the HTML / CSS files you'll need to
 add your own information.
* There are no build steps, it's just three files.
* There are definitely better ways to build this thing but I hacked it
 together, and it does the job :)

## Deploying miniterm

* There's no deployment process really - you'll just need to drop it into whatever
 stack you're going to host it on.
* It will also deploy and run directly in Netlify with no modifications by specifying this Github repo.
 
## Contributing

* If you've got questions, ideas for improvement, or new commands, I'd love to
 hear them. Feel free to file an issue, create a branch and submit a pull request.

## License

* Free for personal use. I'd love to know if you use it and what you do with it
